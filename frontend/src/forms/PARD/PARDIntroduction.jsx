                Need Support? Introducing the CTS-OSA Psychosocial Assistance and Referral Desk (PARD)

                Dear UP Mindanao Community, 
            </p>
            <p className="leading-7">
                The CTS-OSA recognizes the many challenges you may face as students and
                personnel. To provide support, we've established the Psychosocial Assistance and
                Referral Desk (PARD)—an online system connecting you to counseling,
                psychotherapy, and, when needed, referrals to psychiatric services at places like
                IPBM in Davao City.
                If you're feeling overwhelmed or just need someone to talk to, we're here for you.
                To get started, please register on this platform for Psychosocial Assistance and
                Referral. Our CTS personnel will conduct an initial assessment and guide you to the
                appropriate resources. Please know that all information shared will be kept strictly
                confidential. Thank you for reaching out.
                
            </p>
